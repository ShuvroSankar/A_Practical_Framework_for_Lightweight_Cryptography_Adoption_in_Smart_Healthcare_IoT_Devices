# A_Practical_Framework_for_Lightweight_Cryptography_Adoption_in_Smart_Healthcare_IoT_Devices
We prototype the framework on an ESP32 sensor node and ESP32-C6 gateway communicating via ESP-NOW. Experimental evaluation shows that the sys- tem sustains approximately 35kB/s ciphertext throughput with 99.97% authenticated packet success, achieving a mean round- trip latency of 4.14 ms.
